    <h1>Does China's Past Population Give Us an Insight Into Their Future?</h1>

    <h4>Chinese population data exploration</h4>
    <p>The Chinese Population has made its way to 1.4 billion in the year 2024. However, <a href=https://chinapower.csis.org/china-demographics-challenges/>many experts</a> are saying that China is in trouble due to their so called demographic bomb. In fact, since 2022 China's population has been decreasing after a steady period of
    consistent growth. The shrinking population issue is worsened by the fact that the population is aging. These problems primarily stem from the one-child policy implemented in 1980 and different administrative divisions looking to adhere to the birth rates put out by the central government 
    of the People's Republic of China. Other events which may have had an effect on both population and birth rates is <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127087/>China's Great Famine</a> beginning in 1959 killing nearly 30 million Chinese citizens. Lastly, Chinese women are contributing to 
    this demographic crisis as well because none of them want to leave their careers or pay the high child care costs. Unfortunately, in a country with very little history of paternity leave, those are the woman's two options.</p>

    <p>
      "Hong Kongâ€™s Family Planning Association said in a separate release on Tuesday that the number of childless women in the special Chinese administrative region more than doubled from five years ago to 43.2% last year." [<a href=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-fertility-rate-record-low-rcna100353>Source</a>]
    </p>
    
    <p>Through looking at population data and fertility rates, I believe these facts will be visualized and more easily understood. <b>My hypothesis is that the population of China is aging and fertility rates began dropping beginning with the Great Famine and 
    continued to go down following the one-child policy in 1980.

    The geographic transoformations below display the data from a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_administrative_divisions_by_population#>Wikipedia</a> dataset. Additionally, the stacked bar chart and line graph below the geographic
    transforms were gleaned from the <a href=https://population.un.org/dataportal/>United Nations Data Portal</a>.
